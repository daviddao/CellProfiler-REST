The CellProfiler Analyst project is developed in Python and tested under Mac 
OSX 10.5, Windows XP, and to a lesser extent some versions of Linux.


Code may be checked out from our SVN repository here:
  https://svn.broadinstitute.org/CellProfiler/trunk/CPAnalyst/


To run the developer version, you will need Python 2.5 and the following python 
packages:

 - wx 2.8.10
 - MySQLdb 1.2.2
 - pysqlite2 (if using SQLite)
 - numpy 1.3
 - scipy 0.7
 - matplotlib 0.98 (for plotting functionality)
 - PIL 1.1.6

It might be possible to run CPAnalyst with other versions of Python or
these packages.

CellProfiler Analyst can be run from a terminal as follows:
 % python CPAnalyst/cpa/cpa.py

Some functionality of CPAnalyst depends on having an installation 
of CellProfiler 2.0's source code available and on the PYTHONPATH.

Classifier using MySQL can be sped up by installing the UDF in
mysql_plugins/classify.c. To add this function to MySQL, compile
classify.c to classify.so, and put this in a directory on the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH for MySQL, then execute this statement within MySQL:
mysql> CREATE FUNCTION classifier RETURNS INTEGER SONAME 'classify.so';
